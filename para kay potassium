Remember our first convo? yung nag–first move ka? 05/07/25, 1:22 PM nagreact lang muna ako kasi hindi ko rin alam kung ano sasabihin ko (nagulat ako) HAHAHAHAHAHAH tapos after a few minutes, around 2:23 PM, nagsend na rin ako HAHAHAHUHAWUAHA
hindi ko rin talaga alam kung bakit, everything just started to flow naturally.
Ang bilis din pala ng pangyayari dati, na para bang close na close na agad tayo noon?! It just feels so nice to look back lang sa mga moments na nangyari sa atin.

Almost 7 months na rin tayong nag-uusap at magkakilala, and I'm glad that we're still waiting. sana tumagal pa tayo. kahit sa ganito lang muna, I'm super happy na.


Kade, sobrang thankful ako sayo, for being real, for your effort, and for those times na hindi mo ako iniwan kahit ang hirap kong intindihin minsan, at lagi kang nandyan para sa akin. thank you so much for always choosing to stay, even when things get a little difficult.

I really appreciate every little thing you do, the way you listen, the way you understand me kahit minsan ang sabog ko, and how you always make me feel seen and valued. you have this kind of calm energy na nakakagaan talaga ng araw.

Thank you for being that person I can talk to anytime, for making me laugh even on my bad days, and for making everything feel lighter just by being you. I honestly don't know what I did to deserve someone like you, but I'm genuinely grateful that I met you.


Gusto ko rin mag- sorry. sorry kung may mga times na hindi ko naipakita o nasabi kung gaano kita ka-appreciate. sorry kung may mga nasasabi akong nakakasakit, or may mga moments na baka na-feel mo na parang wala ka lang sakin, kahit sa totoo lang, gusto ko talaga ayusin lahat tuwing may hindi tayo pagkakaintindihan.

Hindi ko naman ginusto na masaktan ka. nadadala lang din talaga ako minsan ng takot, overthinking, or pride and ayun, ako rin naman ang nasasaktan sa huli.I'm really sorry for all the things I did, for the words I shouldn't have said, and for the moments I made you feel less than what you truly are to me.

You mean a lot to me, and I never want you to feel unappreciated or unwanted. I'm still learning, still trying to be better for you, for me, and for us. 


Sana you're really doing okay. If ever may pinagdadaanan ka ngayon, please know that you can always talk to me, I'll always be here to listen.

Pero tandaan mo rin, it's okay to rest. It's okay to slow down. It doesn't mean na mahina ka kapag napagod ka. you deserve to breathe, to pause, and to take care of yourself too.

 Hindi mo kailangang harapin lahat mag- isa, okay? I'm here, maybe not always perfectly, but always genuinely.so please, take it easy on yourself. you're doing your best, and that's more than enough.
